when setting up, please check the list of all auditory devices by
```devList = PsychPortAudio('GetDevices')```
Then choose the correct DeviceIndex to replace the [] in line  100:
```pahandle = PsychPortAudio('Open', [], 1, 3, sampRate, 2);```
and check if the DefaultSampleRate is consistent with line 48:
```sampRate = 48000;       % for PsychPortAudio initiation```
Finally, make sure the system volumn is recorded and make sure to use this 
volumn for all subjects.
